## Market Opportunities

- **Capture Riders from Discontinued Models**
  Opportunity Description: With Yamaha FJR1300 and Kawasaki GTR discontinued, their owners have limited upgrade options. BMW can actively court these riders through trade-in programs and demo events.

- **Partner with Tour Operators**
  Opportunity Description: Guided motorcycle tours in Spain are popular with European tourists. BMW could market the RT for tour operator fleets and establish exclusive partnerships.

- **Develop Entry-Level Touring Model**
  Opportunity Description: Create a lighter "mini-RT" using the F900 platform to capture younger riders and compete with Honda NT1100 in the crossover-touring segment.

- **Electric Touring Future**
  Opportunity Description: Leverage BMW's EV experience (CE-04 scooter) to develop the first viable electric tourer when battery technology allows, securing eco-conscious riders.

- **Financing and Value Packages**
  Opportunity Description: Given price sensitivity, develop attractive BMW Select financing options and include maintenance/warranty packages to improve value perception.
