## Understanding Attribute Resonance

The Weighted Resonance Index (WRI) measures how strongly different product attributes resonate with consumers in each market. This comprehensive score analyzes 20 key attributes across four dimensions:

- **Social Discussion Importance (30%)**: Volume and sentiment of social media conversations and online forums
- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (25%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (25%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (20%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights
Overall Comfort:
- Insight: Spanish riders prioritize all-day comfort above all else, expecting upright riding positions, plush seating, and relaxed ergonomics. The R1300RT's advanced rider triangle and improved seating position directly address these expectations.
- Recommendation: Continue prioritizing ergonomic refinements and offer comfort-enhancing accessories like adjustable seats and back support options to maintain segment leadership.

Wind Protection:
- Insight: Effective weather protection is non-negotiable for Spanish touring riders who face varied conditions from Mediterranean heat to Pyrenean cold. The R1300RT's aerodynamic flaps and revised fairing show BMW understands this critical need.
- Recommendation: Highlight the new aerodynamic innovations in marketing and offer optional taller touring screens for different rider heights to maximize protection effectiveness.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: The adaptive ride height feature (Dynamic ESA) that lowers the bike when stopping directly addresses Spanish riders' concerns about managing heavy touring bikes, especially important for varied rider heights.
- Recommendation: Actively promote the adaptive height technology as a key differentiator and ensure dealers demonstrate this feature during test rides to convert concerned prospects.

Engine Performance:
- Insight: The 145 CV boxer engine generates strong positive sentiment, with riders expecting effortless power for mountain passes and highway overtaking while maintaining BMW's characteristic smoothness.
- Recommendation: Emphasize the increased power without increased fuel consumption and ensure throttle mapping provides smooth, predictable power delivery across all riding modes.

Technology & Features:
- Insight: Spanish riders show high interest in advanced features like Adaptive Cruise Control and ASA, but concerns about complexity and reliability persist among traditionalists.
- Recommendation: Implement comprehensive dealer training programs and customer education initiatives to demonstrate practical benefits and user-friendliness of new technologies.

Innovation & Future-proofing:
- Insight: Being first-to-market with technologies like ASA positions BMW as the segment innovator, appealing to tech-savvy riders while raising concerns among reliability-focused traditionalists.
- Recommendation: Balance innovation messaging with reliability assurances, highlighting extensive testing and quality control measures for new technologies.

Brand Image & Reputation:
- Insight: BMW's touring heritage remains strong in Spain, though some perceive the brand as drifting toward over-techification at the expense of traditional touring values.
- Recommendation: Reinforce connection to RT heritage while positioning technology as enhancing rather than replacing traditional touring excellence.

Safety Features:
- Insight: Comprehensive safety electronics are increasingly expected in premium tourers, with Spanish riders valuing features like ABS Pro and collision warning for varied riding conditions.
- Recommendation: Continue safety innovation leadership and clearly communicate how each feature enhances real-world riding scenarios, especially for two-up touring.

Handling & Stability:
- Insight: The R1300RT's lighter, more agile character appeals to Spanish riders who value capability on twisty mountain roads without sacrificing high-speed stability.
- Recommendation: Maintain focus on agile handling as a key differentiator versus heavier competitors while ensuring loaded stability meets touring expectations.

Engine Character & Sound:
- Insight: The distinctive boxer engine character remains a strong emotional connection point, with riders praising the characteristic "grunt" and refined power delivery.
- Recommendation: Preserve the boxer's unique character in future developments while continuing refinement for smoothness and reduced vibration.

Range & Fuel Efficiency:
- Insight: The 400+ km range meets Spanish touring needs well, with maintained fuel consumption despite increased power being particularly appreciated given fuel costs.
- Recommendation: Continue optimizing efficiency and highlight practical range benefits for popular Spanish touring routes in marketing materials.

Dealer & Service Network:
- Insight: BMW's extensive Spanish dealer network and financing options like BMW Select are valued, though not primary purchase drivers for this premium segment.
- Recommendation: Strengthen dealer service quality and consider touring-specific service packages to enhance ownership experience and loyalty.

Passenger Comfort:
- Insight: While improved with more legroom, passenger accommodations remain slightly sport-oriented compared to Gold Wing, affecting two-up touring appeal.
- Recommendation: Develop optional passenger comfort packages including armrests and enhanced backrests to better compete for couples touring market.

Luggage Capacity:
- Insight: The new angular panniers generate mixed reactions, with practical capacity concerns despite aesthetic preferences varying among riders.
- Recommendation: Ensure panniers accommodate common items like full-face helmets and consider including top case in promotional packages.

Resale Value:
- Insight: High initial price creates implicit concerns about depreciation, though BMW's premium positioning generally supports strong residual values.
- Recommendation: Communicate historical RT resale strength and consider guaranteed buyback programs to alleviate long-term value concerns.

Weight Management:
- Insight: Despite innovative solutions like adaptive ride height, the bike's weight remains a concern for some riders, particularly with full options installed.
- Recommendation: Emphasize weight-mitigating technologies and low center of gravity benefits while exploring further weight reduction opportunities.

Low-Speed Maneuverability:
- Insight: Lack of reverse gear compared to Gold Wing is noted, though adaptive ride height partially compensates for low-speed handling concerns.
- Recommendation: Consider adding reverse assist option similar to K1600 and heavily promote existing low-speed handling aids.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: Despite high consumer priority, this attribute suffers from strong negative sentiment due to fears about electronic complexity compromising traditional BMW durability.
- Recommendation: Implement extended warranty programs and communicate rigorous testing protocols to rebuild confidence in long-term reliability.

Design & Aesthetics:
- Insight: The radical styling departure has created the strongest negative reaction, with many loyalists feeling BMW has abandoned classic RT elegance for excessive sportiness.
- Recommendation: Offer heritage-inspired color schemes and consider aesthetic options that nod to traditional RT design while maintaining modern functionality.

Value for Money:
