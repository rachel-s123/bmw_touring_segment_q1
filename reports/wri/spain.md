## Understanding Attribute Resonance

The Weighted Resonance Index (WRI) measures how strongly different product attributes resonate with consumers in each market. This comprehensive score analyzes 20 key attributes across four dimensions:

- **Social Discussion Importance (40%)**: Volume and sentiment of social media conversations and online forums
- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (30%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (20%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (10%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights

**Overall Comfort**:
- Insight: Highest priority attribute with near-perfect resonance. Spanish riders consider comfort non-negotiable for long-distance touring, expecting upright, all-day riding positions and plush seating.
- Recommendation: Continue prioritizing ergonomic design with adjustable seat heights, spacious legroom, and back support. Monitor post-launch feedback for Spain's specific climate conditions.

**Wind Protection**:
- Insight: Top-tier attribute reflecting the importance of effective weather shielding. The R1300RT's revised fairing and aerodynamic flaps are positively received.
- Recommendation: Ensure windshield adjustability accommodates varying rider heights. Highlight innovative flaps in marketing as comfort innovation. Consider taller touring screen options.

**Engine Performance**:
- Insight: The 145 CV boxer engine generates overwhelmingly positive sentiment. Riders expect effortless power for mountain passes and highway overtaking "sin despeinarse" (without breaking a sweat).
- Recommendation: Emphasize improved power without increased fuel consumption. Ensure smooth throttle response and maintain engine mode versatility (Rain/Road/Dynamic).

**Technology & Features**:
- Insight: High resonance despite some reliability concerns. Features like Adaptive Cruise Control and ASA generate excitement among tech-savvy riders but also complexity fears.
- Recommendation: Prioritize user experience and seamless integration. Provide comprehensive dealer training and customer education on practical benefits of each feature.

**Design & Aesthetics**:
- Insight: Most polarizing attribute with 50% negative sentiment. Radical departure from classic RT aesthetic has alienated loyal enthusiasts who compare it unfavorably to adventure bikes.
- Recommendation: Offer classic color liveries and aesthetic accessory packages. Organize showroom events for physical interaction. Consider mid-cycle refresh if sales impact significant.

**Value for Money**:
- Insight: Lowest resonance score despite medium consumer importance. €24,680 base price considered "infumable" (unpalatable) with reliance on financing for accessibility.
- Recommendation: Articulate compelling value proposition highlighting comprehensive standard features. Leverage BMW Select financing and consider including maintenance packages or accessories in launch editions.

**Reliability & Durability**:
- Insight: Major trust deficit with 30/100 social sentiment despite 90/100 consumer importance. Fears that extensive technology will compromise long-term reliability.
- Recommendation: Communicate rigorous testing protocols and quality measures. Offer extended warranties or service packages. Share success stories of high-mileage, trouble-free ownership.

### Strategic Recommendations

Short Term:
- Launch comprehensive dealer education program on technology features, especially ASA and radar systems
- Develop classic aesthetic accessory packages to address design concerns
- Create compelling financing packages with maintenance included for first 3 years

Long Term:
- Monitor reliability data closely and address any issues transparently to rebuild trust
- Consider development of lighter, more accessible touring model using F900 platform
- Position for future electric touring development leveraging BMW EV expertise

Priorities:
- Reinforce leadership in core comfort and protection attributes
- Address design backlash through customization options and marketing
- Build value perception and reliability trust through comprehensive ownership packages

Methodology Notes:
WRI calculation weighted 40% Social Listening, 30% Sales Data, 20% Consumer Reviews, 10% Expert Analysis to prioritize real-time market feedback and actual performance over traditional metrics. This approach is critical for controversial launches where initial perception significantly influences trajectory.
