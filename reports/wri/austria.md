## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights
Overall Comfort:
- Insight: Consistently identified as the paramount priority for Austrian touring riders, representing not merely a desirable feature but a foundational expectation. BMW's specific improvements like adjustable deflectors and enhanced passenger space have elevated comfort from a hygiene factor to a competitive differentiator.
- Recommendation: Continue prioritizing comfort in every product development decision and leverage testimonials highlighting specific comfort benefits to maintain market leadership.

- Recommendation: Position safety technology as essential touring equipment that provides peace of mind and practical benefits for long-distance travel, emphasizing fatigue reduction and risk mitigation.

Engine Performance:
- Insight: Touring riders seek confident, accessible power for mountain passes and two-up riding. The R1300RT's 145hp and superior power-to-weight ratio addresses practical needs like easier overtaking and comfortable passenger carrying rather than pure performance metrics.
- Recommendation: Market engine performance in context of practical touring benefits - effortless climbing, safe overtaking, and spirited riding capability that transforms journeys from endurance tests to enjoyable adventures.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: While reliability doesn't generate discussion when functioning correctly, it fundamentally underpins purchase confidence for long-distance touring. Past BMW transmission issues create legacy concerns that could be reactivated by new problems.
