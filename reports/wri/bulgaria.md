## Understanding Attribute Resonance

The Weighted Resonance Index (WRI) measures how strongly different product attributes resonate with consumers in each market. This comprehensive score analyzes 20 key attributes across four dimensions:

- **Social Discussion Importance (30%)**: Volume and sentiment of social media conversations and online forums
- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (25%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (25%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (20%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

- Recommendation: Continue to prioritize innovation in product development and marketing, emphasizing how the RT represents the future of touring motorcycles.

Technology & Features:
- Insight: Features like adaptive cruise control and advanced rider aids were frequently highlighted as competitive advantages, appealing strongly to tech-savvy riders.
- Recommendation: Market the bike's tech strengths prominently. Address navigation interface issues via software updates or better user education to turn current negatives into positives.

Wind Protection:
- Insight: A critical aspect of overall comfort, the R1300RT's improved fairing and adjustable windscreen were specifically lauded for enhancing long-distance ride quality.
- Recommendation: Tout aerodynamic innovations and ensure dealer units have windscreen demos. Continue R&D in quieter screens and adjustable aero features.

Range & Fuel Efficiency:
- Insight: Riders expressed strong interest in fuel range, considering it a must-have for touring. The R1300RT's large tank and efficient engine were noted as significant advantages.
- Recommendation: Promote the RT's range as an advantage over competitors. Preserve fuel capacity and optimize economy in future planning.

Handling & Stability:
- Insight: Despite its size, the R1300RT's improved handling and stability due to weight reduction and chassis enhancements were a frequent discussion point, fostering excitement.
- Recommendation: In test rides or marketing, demonstrate the RT's agility. Keep weight as low as possible in future revisions and consider performance tire options.

Luggage Capacity:
- Insight: The practical need for ample storage for touring gear was a consistent theme. The R1300RT's competitive pannier volumes were noted as a strong point.
- Recommendation: Ensure every RT dealer demo has luggage on display. Maintain or increase luggage capacity if possible and consider clever storage solutions.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: Directly tied to comfort, discussions around adjustable seat heights and rider triangle indicated its importance for rider fit and long-distance comfort.
- Recommendation: Emphasize that the RT is surprisingly easy to balance. Consider offering features like reverse assist and adaptive lowering for future models.

Passenger Comfort:

- Recommendation: Market the RT as "built for two". Include pillion feedback in promotions and ensure dealers mention two-up comfort capabilities.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: Though not a flashy attribute, the expectation of a "rock-solid" bike for high mileage touring was evident, reinforced by the RT's use by authorities.
- Recommendation: Back up reliability record with warranty extensions. Focus on robust engineering for heavy loads and long hours of operation.

Safety Features:
- Insight: While not always explicitly discussed, the presence of advanced safety aids like collision warnings and blind-spot monitoring adds significant peace of mind, particularly for an older demographic.
- Recommendation: Educate potential buyers on less-obvious safety features. Prioritize safety innovations in development to solidify RT as safest tourer choice.

Low-Speed Maneuverability:
- Insight: Concerns about managing a heavy touring bike at low speeds (parking, U-turns) were present, making features that aid this important.
- Recommendation: Emphasize that the RT is surprisingly easy to balance. Consider reverse assist and adaptive lowering features for future development.

Weight Management:
- Insight: The R1300RT's weight reduction was noted positively, contributing to perceptions of agility and overall manageability, though it remains a heavy bike in absolute terms.
- Recommendation: Continue weight reduction efforts using lighter materials, as this underpins many other positive attributes including performance and handling.

Dealer & Service Network:
- Insight: The availability of reliable service and parts is crucial for touring riders, although not a primary discussion point unless issues arise.
- Recommendation: Ensure robust dealer coverage and service capabilities. Highlight BMW's touring support network as a competitive advantage.

Resale Value:

- Insight: The R1300RT's new styling was somewhat polarizing, with mixed sentiment. While some liked its modern lines, it was not a universal appeal or primary purchase driver.
- Recommendation: Offer attractive color options and show the bike in motion. Accept that styling is subjective and focus marketing on functional benefits.

Engine Character & Sound:
- Insight: Discussions around the boxer engine's character versus a six-cylinder's smoothness were more philosophical among enthusiasts than a decisive purchase factor for the broader touring audience.
- Recommendation: Focus marketing on performance benefits rather than engine character. Continue to refine engine refinement and midrange punch.

Value for Money:
- Insight: The R1300RT's high price point was the most common negative sentiment and a significant barrier to purchase, especially in the price-sensitive Bulgarian market.
