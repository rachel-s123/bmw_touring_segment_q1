## Understanding Attribute Resonance

The Weighted Resonance Index (WRI) measures how strongly different product attributes resonate with consumers in each market. This comprehensive score analyzes 20 key attributes across four dimensions:

- **Social Discussion Importance (30%)**: Volume and sentiment of social media conversations and online forums
- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (25%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (25%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (20%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights
Overall Comfort:
- Insight: Italian riders prioritize comfort above all else, with wind protection, seat comfort, and fatigue-free riding defining the touring experience. "500 km as if sitting on the couch at home" encapsulates this priority.
- Recommendation: Lead all marketing with comfort messaging, ensure test rides showcase highway wind protection and suspension comfort, highlight adjustable ergonomics and seat options.

Technology & Features:
- Insight: Modern tech including radar ACC, large TFT displays, and connectivity strongly influence purchase decisions. Italian consumers are tech-savvy and view these as key differentiators in the premium segment.
- Recommendation: Actively promote BMW's first-to-market features, create educational content about radar cruise control benefits, emphasize proven reliability of electronic systems.

Engine Performance:
- Insight: Powerful yet smooth engines are paramount for effortless touring. Italian riders value both raw power (130+ hp) and refinement, with BMW's boxer delivering "erogazione sempre fluida e vigorosa."
- Recommendation: Emphasize the new 145 hp engine in test rides, highlight strong midrange torque for overtaking, promote the distinctive boxer character that combines power with smoothness.

Passenger Comfort:
- Insight: Equally crucial to rider comfort, often the deciding factor in purchase. "Many choose one bike over another based on their partner's comfort" reflects the importance of two-up touring capability.
- Recommendation: Invite couples to test rides, feature passenger testimonials in marketing, highlight specific passenger amenities like backrests and wind protection.

Handling & Stability:
- Insight: Despite their size, touring bikes must feel "insospettabilmente maneggevole" (surprisingly nimble). Italian riders value confidence-inspiring handling on both highways and mountain roads.
- Recommendation: Organize demo rides on twisty routes to showcase agility, emphasize Telelever front end benefits, compare favorably to competitors' handling characteristics.

Innovation & Future-proofing:
- Insight: Strong desire for cutting-edge features that enhance safety and convenience, but conditional on reliability. "Excitement for innovation prevails" but with caution about complexity.
- Recommendation: Position new features as "proven technology," highlight rigorous testing procedures, offer extended warranties on electronic components.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: "Mai un problema" resonates strongly with touring riders who need confidence for long trips. BMW must overcome past reliability perceptions while leveraging its improving reputation.
- Recommendation: Include comprehensive warranty packages, share high-mileage owner stories, emphasize BMW's use by police forces as proof of durability.

Luggage Capacity:
- Insight: Fundamental requirement for touring with integrated panniers being non-negotiable. Discussions revolve around waterproofing, capacity for two helmets, and convenience features.
- Recommendation: Highlight standard 37L panniers, demonstrate electric locking system, show practical packing scenarios for extended tours.

Wind Protection:
- Insight: Critical for comfort with RT's broad fairing cited as best-in-class. Good protection "fa la differenza d'inverno" and directly impacts fatigue on long rides.
- Recommendation: Feature the electric adjustable windscreen prominently, conduct wind tunnel demonstrations, compare protection levels to competitors.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: Adjustability crucial for rider confidence, especially for those under 1.8m. "Posizione di guida rilassante" contributes to whether riders feel "at home" during test rides.
- Recommendation: Offer multiple seat heights at no extra charge, provide low seat options for demos, create confidence-building programs for shorter riders.

Range & Fuel Efficiency:
- Insight: Practical concern for tour planning with 400km range being a benchmark. Italian tourers compare range especially when planning Alpine or remote area trips.
- Recommendation: Emphasize the RT's 350km+ range, highlight fuel efficiency improvements, provide range calculator tools for trip planning.

Low-Speed Maneuverability:
- Insight: Common pain point with weight "felt in maneuvers at standstill." Riders under 1.8m particularly struggle with tip-toeing at stops and careful balance needs.
- Recommendation: Highlight 1.4kg weight reduction in new model, offer maneuvering clinics, consider future reverse assist options.

Design & Aesthetics:
- Insight: Polarizing reactions with some finding RT bulky or "scooter-like" from front. Italian market values "bella figura" but will compromise for superior function.
- Recommendation: Showcase Option 719 paint schemes, emphasize aerodynamic improvements, ensure in-person viewing opportunities as bike looks better live.

Weight Management:
- Insight: Acknowledged as "necessary trade-off" but still a complaint. "Though heavy, once moving it's easy" is common refrain accepting but not loving the weight.
- Recommendation: Communicate weight reduction efforts, emphasize low center of gravity benefits, provide handling confidence courses.

Resale Value:
- Insight: BMW RTs "resell well and hold value over years" providing financial justification for premium pricing. Important for total cost of ownership calculations.
- Recommendation: Include resale value data in sales materials, offer guaranteed buyback programs, highlight lower depreciation versus competitors.

Engine Character & Sound:
- Insight: Distinctive boxer character appreciated but some find it "troppo rumoroso" on long trips. Balance needed between character and refinement.
- Recommendation: Emphasize improved sound insulation in new model, highlight smooth power delivery, offer optional exhaust options for preference.

Dealer & Service Network:
- Insight: BMW's extensive Italian network provides confidence for touring riders who value support when far from home. Practical consideration rather than emotional driver.
- Recommendation: Highlight dealer density in touring regions, offer European roadside assistance, create touring-specific service packages.

Brand Image & Reputation:
- Insight: BMW associated with "prestige, innovation, and esprit de corps." RT ownership seen as dream or status symbol reinforcing purchase decisions.
- Recommendation: Leverage police usage for credibility, feature owner clubs and communities, emphasize German engineering heritage.

Value for Money:
