## Report Structure

Place markdown reports in the following directories:

## Data Generation

The dashboard requires several data files to be generated from the markdown reports. These files are located in `src/data/`:

- `wriData.js` - WRI data
- `wriInsights.js` - WRI insights
- `competitorData.js` - Competitor analysis data
- `conversationData.js` - Conversation data
- `executiveSummaries.js` - Executive summaries
- `marketRecommendations.js` - Market recommendations
- `marketIntroductions.js` - Market introductions
- `marketSources.js` - Market sources
- `attributeResonance.js` - Attribute resonance data

Generate these files by running the following scripts:
```bash
# Generate WRI data
npm run generate-wri-data

# Generate competitor analysis data
npm run generate-competitor-data

# Generate conversation data
npm run generate-conversation-data

# Generate executive summaries
npm run generate-executive-summaries

# Generate market recommendations
npm run generate-market-recommendations

# Generate market introductions
npm run generate-market-introductions
```

   Example: `public/reports/france_report.pdf`

2. The PDF viewer supports:
   - Continuous scrolling
   - Fullscreen mode
