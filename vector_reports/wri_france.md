- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (25%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (25%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (20%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights
Overall Comfort:
- Insight: Unequivocally the paramount factor, with "Confort, Confort, Confort" as the #1 recurring theme. French riders demand all-day comfort for both rider and passenger, viewing it as non-negotiable for any serious touring motorcycle.
- Recommendation: BMW should intensify focus on highlighting the R1300RT's superior comfort features in all communications, using French customer testimonials about fatigue-free long-distance rides.

Wind Protection:
- Insight: Closely tied to comfort, effective windshields and fairings offering "incredible protection, sheltered from the slightest breath of air" are highly valued. French riders expect comprehensive protection from wind and weather.
- Recommendation: Promote the new adjustable wind deflectors and emphasize all-weather riding capability in marketing materials, showcasing the RT's superior protection features.

Passenger Comfort:
- Insight: Crucial purchase driver as many French touring riders travel with a spouse/partner. Features like roomy seats, backrests, and heated options are actively sought and can be deal-breakers if inadequate.
- Recommendation: Highlight two-up touring capabilities and passenger-specific comfort features in marketing, potentially offering test rides for couples.

Handling & Stability:
- Insight: The ability to handle twisty roads while maintaining high-speed stability is fundamental. French riders value bikes that "se manient aisément dans les virages" despite their mass, especially given France's varied terrain.
- Recommendation: Emphasize BMW's Telelever suspension and balanced performance in marketing, showcase the bike's agility in mountainous regions like the Alps.

Engine Performance:
- Insight: Ample power and torque highly valued for two-up riding with luggage. The R1300RT's 145hp making it "la RT la plus puissante jamais produite" generates pride and ensures effortless overtakes.
- Recommendation: Market the increased power as enabling safer overtaking and effortless mountain climbing, appealing to riders' sense of capability and safety.

Technology & Features:
- Insight: Modern features have transitioned from luxuries to fundamental expectations. BMW's "dotation technologique impressionnante" including radar cruise control generated significant excitement.
- Recommendation: Create educational content and dealership workshops to demonstrate advanced features, positioning the R1300RT as the most technologically advanced tourer.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: Crucial for long, remote journeys. BMW's use by French police serves as strong quality signal, with riders actively inquiring about reliability before purchasing.
- Recommendation: Leverage police fleet usage in marketing and ensure flawless launch quality to maintain reputation for long-term durability.

Luggage Capacity:
- Insight: Integrated storage ability is important for multi-day trips. BMW RT's standard side cases praised, while competitors criticized for making them optional or reducing capacity.
- Recommendation: Emphasize the standard luggage inclusion and total capacity in marketing, showing practical loading scenarios for touring.

Safety Features:
- Insight: Advanced safety technologies like radar-assisted cruise control, adaptive LED headlights, and comprehensive rider aids are highly valued for long-distance travel confidence.
- Recommendation: Create content explaining how each safety feature benefits real-world touring scenarios, particularly in challenging conditions.

Weight Management:
- Insight: How weight is managed matters more than raw numbers. The 17kg reduction in R1300RT was notable, with riders seeking low center of gravity and clever engineering to mask mass.
- Recommendation: Address weight concerns proactively through low-speed handling courses and emphasize engineering solutions that improve maneuverability.

Low-Speed Maneuverability:
- Insight: Significant pain point and direct purchase driver. Handling in parking lots and city traffic often determines whether riders feel confident enough to purchase, especially for shorter individuals.
- Recommendation: Offer complimentary handling courses with purchase and ensure test rides include low-speed scenarios to build confidence.

Range & Fuel Efficiency:
- Insight: Ability to travel 300-400km between fuel stops is expected. The R1300RT's claimed 4.9L/100km efficiency addresses this well, as range under 300km is considered sub-par.
- Recommendation: Highlight the improved fuel efficiency and resulting range in marketing, emphasizing practical touring autonomy.

Value for Money:
- Insight: While buyers are price-sensitive, the premium segment accepts high prices if justified by features and quality. The "on n'a qu'une vie, fais-toi plaisir" mentality drives passion purchases.
- Recommendation: Focus on demonstrable superiority in high-resonance attributes rather than competing on price, reinforcing value through quality and experience.

Brand Image & Reputation:
- Insight: BMW's premium image and police usage provide confidence. Brand reputation contributes to loyalty and resale values, with emotional attachment playing a role in purchase decisions.
- Recommendation: Maintain police fleet relationships and subtly publicize this usage as quality validation, while nurturing owner community engagement.

Design & Aesthetics:
- Insight: While function trumps form, the R1300RT's "nouvelle plastique inédite et plutôt réussie" was positively received. Visual appeal contributes to pride of ownership as a supporting factor.
- Recommendation: Showcase the modern design evolution in marketing while maintaining focus on functional benefits.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: Accessibility matters with frequent questions about reach to ground. The RT's adjustable seat from 780mm addresses this, though width can offset benefits for some riders.
- Recommendation: Emphasize adjustability options and offer various seat heights, ensuring dealerships have models set up for different rider sizes.

Engine Character & Sound:
- Insight: The emotional connection from engine character matters to many riders. BMW's boxer engine has distinct character, though some prefer the "soulful rumble" of other engines.
- Recommendation: Highlight the unique boxer engine character in experiential marketing while respecting that preferences vary.

Dealer & Service Network:
- Insight: BMW's extensive European network provides confidence for long-term ownership and touring support, though it's a secondary consideration after product attributes.
- Recommendation: Maintain service excellence and promote network coverage for touring peace of mind without making it a primary message.

Resale Value:
- Insight: Pragmatic consideration for experienced riders who frequently upgrade. BMW generally maintains strong residuals due to reputation, though not top-of-mind during initial purchase.
- Recommendation: Mention strong resale values as a long-term benefit without overemphasizing, as it validates the investment decision.

Innovation & Future-proofing:
- Insight: Riders value cutting-edge technology that won't quickly become obsolete. Radar cruise control implementation shows BMW's innovation leadership, important given competitors' exits due to lack of updates.
