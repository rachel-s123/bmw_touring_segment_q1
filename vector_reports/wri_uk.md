## Understanding Attribute Resonance

The Weighted Resonance Index (WRI) measures how strongly different product attributes resonate with consumers in each market. This comprehensive score analyzes 20 key attributes across four dimensions:

- **Social Discussion Importance (30%)**: Volume and sentiment of social media conversations and online forums
- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (25%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (25%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (20%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights
Overall Comfort:
- Insight: Unanimously identified as "king" of touring attributes, with virtually every online discussion touching upon it as non-negotiable. The R1300RT's lower seat height and improved legroom for pillions are key discussion points.
- Recommendation: Commit to continuous innovation in seating ergonomics and suspension tuning. Offer comfort-focused accessories as standard or attractive upgrades at point of purchase.

Wind Protection:
- Insight: Critical for UK's wet climate, with RT's adjustable screen and aerodynamic tweaks being major talking points. Riders value effective fairing creating a "calm bubble" for all-weather protection.
- Recommendation: Emphasize the R1300RT's superior weather protection in marketing. Consider including taller screen options for tall riders as part of initial purchase options.

Engine Performance:
- Insight: New 1300cc boxer engine's 143hp generates excitement for "giving sportsbikes the hurry-up." Riders value torque for effortless overtaking more than peak horsepower.
- Recommendation: Market the engine's flexible power delivery and two-up capability. Organize demo events showcasing acceleration and overtaking prowess.

Handling & Stability:
- Insight: RT praised for feeling "manageable" and handling "like a smaller bike" despite size. Telelever suspension prevents dive and enhances confidence when loaded.
- Recommendation: Continue emphasizing the RT's agility advantage over bulkier rivals. Highlight predictable handling as a safety feature for touring.

Technology & Features:
- Insight: "Tech-laden nature" and "car-like tech" generate considerable excitement. Radar cruise and connectivity position BMW as technology leader in segment.
- Recommendation: Position advanced tech primarily as safety enhancements and fatigue reducers rather than luxury gadgets. Develop "stress-free touring" narrative.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: Skepticism exists about "first-year model gremlins" and BMW's complex electronics, contrasting with Honda's "bulletproof" reputation. Past RT issues with electronics create concern.
- Recommendation: Proactively address reliability concerns through transparent communication about testing processes. Offer extended warranty options for peace of mind.

Innovation & Future-proofing:
- Insight: BMW's ability to "push the tech envelope" attracts buyers seeking modern, advanced motorcycles. Setting "new benchmark" status appeals to early adopters.
- Recommendation: Continue positioning BMW as the innovation leader. Highlight how current features anticipate future touring needs.

Safety Features:
- Insight: Advanced features perceived as "positive for safety and convenience." Adaptive cruise reduces fatigue, contributing to "stress-free touring" narrative.
- Recommendation: Market safety features as essential for the older demographic. Emphasize fatigue reduction and confidence enhancement benefits.

Luggage Capacity:
- Insight: Expandable panniers with central locking highly valued. BMW's 27L+ per side (expandable to 33L) plus 54L topcase meets touring needs well.
- Recommendation: Highlight integrated convenience features alongside raw capacity. Market the practicality of central locking and easy loading.

Value for Money:
- Insight: "Persistent undercurrents" about premium pricing. At £18,900 base, debates center on whether features justify cost, though noted as "half the price of a Gold Wing."
- Recommendation: Offer attractive finance packages and bundle options. Frame price as investment in premium long-term touring experience.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: R1300RT's revised forward-leaning position "spiked debate." Some welcome sportier feel, others worry about comfort for "mainly 60-plus age group."
- Recommendation: Offer adjustable handlebar options and comfort seats. Ensure demo rides allow proper ergonomic assessment.

Low-Speed Maneuverability:
- Insight: "Parking lot" ease frequently discussed. Weight can be barrier for smaller or older riders, affecting accessibility.
- Recommendation: Highlight any weight savings or balance improvements. Consider offering low-speed handling courses for new owners.

Range & Fuel Efficiency:
- Insight: Less passionate discussion but implicitly valued. RT's ~25L tank yields 250-300+ mile range, generally satisfactory for touring needs.
- Recommendation: Emphasize practical range over raw efficiency numbers. Market the freedom from frequent fuel stops on long tours.

Design & Aesthetics:
- Insight: New styling generated "a lot of chatter" with polarized opinions. Some find it modern and attractive, others call it "ugly" or "not my cup of tea."
- Recommendation: Maximize in-person viewing opportunities as many note it "looks better in person." Show bike in real-world touring scenarios.

Engine Character & Sound:
- Insight: Riders appreciate the boxer's "growl" versus Gold Wing's "super-smooth flat-six." Sensory experience valued beyond pure performance metrics.
- Recommendation: Highlight the distinctive BMW boxer character as part of the riding experience. Use sound in marketing materials.

Weight Management:
- Insight: Actual weight and perceived manageability can be deal-breaker for some. RT's lighter weight versus Gold Wing (100kg+ difference) is significant advantage.
- Recommendation: Emphasize weight advantage over competitors. Highlight how Telelever and balance make bike feel lighter than it is.

Passenger Comfort:
- Insight: For many touring riders who travel two-up, passenger comfort is a significant consideration. The R1300RT's improvements, such as increased pillion legroom, are well-received. While the Honda Gold Wing often sets the benchmark for "armchair-like seating," the R1300RT's efforts in this area contribute positively to its appeal.
- Recommendation: Continue to improve pillion accommodations and highlight two-up touring capabilities in marketing materials. Consider offering heated passenger seats as standard equipment.

Dealer & Service Network:
- Insight: Not a "hot forum topic" but provides peace of mind. BMW's strong UK and European network valuable for touring confidence.
- Recommendation: Subtly reinforce dealer network strength in marketing. Highlight European coverage for continental touring.

Brand Image & Reputation:
- Insight: Subtle "pride of owning" flagship tourer. BMW's police use in UK lends credibility. Acts as background reinforcement rather than primary driver.
- Recommendation: Leverage police endorsement and heritage subtly. Let brand reputation support other primary purchase drivers.

Resale Value:
- Insight: "Rarely mentioned in enthusiast circles." While BMWs hold good residuals, touring riders prioritize usage experience over future financial considerations.
- Recommendation: Don't lead with resale value in marketing. Let strong residuals be discovered by practical buyers doing research.
