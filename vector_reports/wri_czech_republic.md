- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.

- Recommendation: Emphasize all-weather comfort in promotions through rider testimonials and ensure dealers have comfort accessories available for buyers to experience personalization options.

Design & Aesthetics:
- Insight: New design language generated mixed sentiment and is lightning rod for opinion. While some appreciate modern sharper look, many find new front-end aesthetics ungainly, potentially impacting purchase willingness.
- Recommendation: Acknowledge design shift positively by explaining functional benefits, showcase bike in multiple colors, and encourage in-person viewing where design often appears more appealing than in photos.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: RT's redesigned ergonomic triangle and low 780mm seat height important for rider fit and control, particularly appealing to aging demographic and shorter riders seeking accessibility.
- Recommendation: Emphasize accessibility features and multiple seat options to demonstrate commitment to accommodating wider range of physical statures and comfort preferences.

Weight Management:
- Insight: While touring bikes are inherently heavy, RT's perceived weight management through low center of gravity and excellent balance provides competitive advantage over heavier alternatives.

- Recommendation: Clearly articulate incremental benefits of new R1300RT over used predecessors to justify premium pricing and counter threat from robust used RT market.
