# Executive Summary: Slovenia

## Attribute Resonance
- Comfort dominates purchase decisions with Overall Comfort (WRI: 93.5) and Passenger Comfort (WRI: 91.5) as top drivers
- Safety Features rank equally high (WRI: 93.5) with radar ACC and collision warnings being widely lauded
- Performance attributes score strongly with Engine Performance and Reliability both at WRI: 88.5

## Market Insights
- R1300RT captured 30% share of voice in touring segment discussions, indicating strong market interest
- Overall sentiment skews positive (55%) but with significant negative sentiment (30%) driven by price and styling concerns
- Adventure bikes continue to draw attention from traditional touring segment, representing internal competition

## Competitor Analysis
- Honda Gold Wing remains comfort benchmark at 25% share of voice but criticized for extreme weight (~380kg)
- Honda NT1100 represents value threat at half the price of R1300RT, appealing to price-sensitive buyers
- BMW's own K1600 series could cannibalize sales with superior engine refinement for luxury-focused buyers

## Strategic Recommendations
- **Strategic Positioning:** Position R1300RT as the "no compromise" touring solution - lighter than Gold Wing, more capable than budget sport-tourers
- **Content & Messaging:** Lead with comfort and safety benefits while actively addressing value concerns through comprehensive feature communication
- **Audience Targeting:** Focus on 40+ experienced tourers while creating pathways for younger riders upgrading from mid-size bikes
- **Key Opportunity:** Leverage post-COVID touring renaissance and Slovenia's central location for European touring routes
