- **Sales & Market Factor Importance (25%)**: Impact on purchase decisions and market performance
- **Consumer Review Focus (25%)**: Frequency and emphasis in customer reviews and feedback
- **Expert Analysis Emphasis (20%)**: Prominence in professional reviews and industry analysis

Each attribute receives a score from 0-100, with higher scores indicating stronger market resonance. This analysis helps identify which product features and characteristics are most important to consumers in different markets, enabling targeted product development and marketing strategies.

## Market Deviation Analysis

To understand how each market differs from the European average, we calculate and visualize deviations using the following methodology:

- **Baseline Calculation**: For each attribute, we establish a European baseline by averaging WRI scores across all markets
- **Deviation Measurement**: Market-specific scores are compared against this baseline, with differences expressed in percentage points (e.g., +15 indicates 15 points above average)
- **Significance Levels**: Deviations are categorized as: • Strong (±15 points or more) • Moderate (±8 to 14 points) • Slight (±3 to 7 points) • Neutral (±2 points)

This comparative analysis helps identify unique market characteristics and opportunities, enabling more targeted market strategies and product positioning. Positive deviations highlight areas of strong attribute importance, while negative deviations may indicate attributes with less significance within a market.
