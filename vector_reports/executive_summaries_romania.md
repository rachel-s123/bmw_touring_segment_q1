## Attribute Resonance
- Comfort reigns supreme with 93.5 WRI score - appearing in 70% of touring discussions
- Technology drives purchase decisions (WRI: 87.5) but navigation interface needs improvement
- Brand prestige reinforced by police use creates powerful trust signal (WRI: 88.5)
- Value sensitivity remains high (WRI: 86.5) despite rising incomes - buyers compare against robust used market

## Market Insights
- Romania's motorcycle market grew 53% in 2024 with 10,199 units - touring remains niche but high-value

- Tech adoption accelerating - Honda sold more DCT automatics than manuals in certain 2024 models
- Touring tourism boom driven by scenic routes (Transfăgărășan) creates functional need for comfort

## Competitor Analysis
- BMW R1300RT leads mindshare with new model excitement and innovation perception
- Honda Gold Wing maintains comfort benchmark but seen as heavy "cruise ship" for Romanian roads
- Yamaha FJR1300 effectively exited with no Euro5 model - creates opportunity gap
- Harley tourers serve different niche with lifestyle appeal but lack performance for serious touring

## Strategic Recommendations
- **Strategic Positioning:** Position as the lighter, more agile premium tourer that's "sporty yet comfortable" for Romania's varied roads
- **Content & Messaging:** Lead with comfort innovations and 145hp performance while addressing value through warranty/service packages
- **Audience Targeting:** Focus on upgrading touring riders 40+, younger professionals stepping up, and tech-savvy two-up couples
- **Key Opportunity:** Convert current market excitement into sales through test rides while fixing navigation to eliminate Gold Wing advantage
