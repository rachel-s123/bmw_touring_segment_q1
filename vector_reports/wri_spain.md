## WRI Insights

### Attribute Insights
Overall Comfort:
- Insight: The single most important purchase driver, consistently emphasized as the primary expectation for a touring motorcycle. Spanish riders expect an upright, all-day riding position, plush seating, and relaxed ergonomics for rider and passenger.
- Recommendation: Continue to prioritize ergonomic design with adjustable seat heights, spacious legroom, and back support. Offer comfort seats or footpeg lowering kits as accessories. This is an area where the RT is traditionally strong and must remain so.

Wind Protection:
- Insight: A defining feature of touring motorcycles, essential for shielding riders from elements and ensuring comfort in all weather conditions. Spanish riders often mention how an RT or Gold Wing lets them ride comfortably in all weather.
- Recommendation: Ensure the windshield is large and adjustable enough for varying heights. Offer a taller touring screen option and highlight the new aerodynamic flaps in marketing as a comfort innovation. Heated grips and seats are expected for cold weather.

Seat Height & Ergonomics:
- Insight: A foundational component of overall comfort, crucial for an all-day riding position and rider confidence, especially for varying statures. The R1300RT addresses this with a more advanced rider triangle and seating.
- Recommendation: Leverage the new RT's adaptive height (Dynamic ESA can lower the bike when stopping) as a brilliant solution. This directly addresses low-speed stability for shorter riders and should be prominently promoted.

Engine Performance:
- Insight: Spanish riders value a powerful, torquey engine that can haul two people and luggage over mountains with ease. The new RT's 1300cc boxer with 145 CV was big news, with many expressing that performance was a given strength.
- Recommendation: Emphasize the improved power without increased fuel consumption. Ensure throttle response is smooth and fueling is flawless. Deliver on the promise that this bike has effortless power in all situations.

Design & Aesthetics:
- Insight: A highly polarizing attribute for the R 1300 RT, generating intense debate. While function often trumps form, pride of ownership and brand image make design important. The previous RT was often described as "guapa" and classy; the new one got "moderna, deportiva" from fans and "fea" from detractors.
- Recommendation: Offer color options or style packages to appease traditionalists. Allow time for the design to be seen in person through showroom open days. Ensure high-quality paint and tight panel gaps to show premium build quality.

Innovation & Future-proofing:
- Insight: Modern riders appreciate cutting-edge technology that enhances the riding experience and positions the bike for future trends. The integration of advanced features is highly valued, positioning BMW as a leader.
- Recommendation: Continue to innovate while ensuring technology doesn't overshadow the core riding feel. Frame tech as enhancing the ride rather than isolating from it. Prepare for future electric touring possibilities.

Technology & Features:
- Insight: Modern touring riders relish having the latest tech that enhances convenience or safety. The R1300RT is packed with Adaptive Cruise Control, ASA, 10.25" TFT, multiple ride modes, and electronic suspension.
- Recommendation: Prioritize integration and user experience of tech features. Ensure the Connectivity Hub is seamless. Provide training or demos so customers fully appreciate these features. Highlight how tech improves the ride, especially ASA and radar.

Brand Image & Reputation:
- Insight: BMW has a strong brand legacy in touring with the "RT" nameplate nearly 50 years old. The company's strategy to offer multiple touring options means they cover sub-segments.
- Recommendation: Strengthen community events and owner groups. Maintain BMW's innovation cadence as a strength. Address any perception of reliability issues from past models to protect brand trust.

Handling & Stability:
- Insight: For a big bike, ease of handling is extremely valued. One reason many Spanish riders prefer the RT over a Gold Wing is its more agile handling (20+ kg lighter, narrower). The new RT has a new chassis and suspension to improve this.
- Recommendation: Maintain a low center of gravity and continue refining suspension to give that magic carpet feel. Communicate improvements like frame rigidity and wider rear tire. Features like dynamic suspension adjustment make handling easier.

Value for Money:
- Insight: Price is a critical factor given these are expensive bikes. Spanish consumers talk about value – what you get for what you pay. Many begrudgingly accept a high price if it's justified by features, quality, and riding experience.
- Recommendation: Articulate the value proposition clearly. Leverage financing offers to improve value perception. Include items like GPS module or top case in launch editions. Offer strong trade-in deals from older RTs.

Reliability & Durability:
- Insight: When riders plan long tours, reliability is crucial. Spanish consumers voice skepticism about new tech's reliability. BMW has to battle a reputation drag from past issues.
- Recommendation: Communicate testing and quality protocols. Offer extensive warranty or service packages. Make the R1300RT bulletproof, especially the new ASA gearbox and electronics. Showcase success stories of trouble-free ownership.

Safety Features:
- Insight: Safety is closely tied to tech including ABS, traction control, stability control, collision warning. Spanish riders often ride in varied conditions and value top-tier safety electronics.
- Recommendation: Continue to innovate in safety with features like blind spot detection. Train dealers to explain these features. Highlight real examples of how ABS Pro might prevent accidents in wet mountain curves.

Engine Character & Sound:
- Insight: While not explicitly detailed as "sound," the "character" and "grunt" of the engine are appreciated, contributing to the overall riding experience and pride of ownership.
- Recommendation: Maintain the boxer engine's distinctive character while refining for smoothness. Consider offering different exhaust options for those who want more audible character without compromising Euro5+ compliance.

Luggage Capacity:
- Insight: Being able to carry ample luggage securely is a core requirement. The RT's side cases (approximately 30L each) and optional 49L top case are usually praised.
- Recommendation: Ensure panniers can hold common items like large full-face helmets. Consider including the top-case in promotions. Emphasize that panniers are easily detachable for convenience at hotels.

Dealer & Service Network:
- Insight: When buying a tourer, customers are also "buying" into a support system. In Spain, BMW has a strong dealer presence in most major cities and popular riding areas.
- Recommendation: Maintain a robust service network and offer touring-specific services. Given premium pricing, Spanish customers expect premium treatment including loaner bikes during service.

Passenger Comfort:
- Insight: Many touring bike buyers have a spouse or partner who rides pillion; their satisfaction is crucial. The RT's top case with backrest and wide seat is generally good, but slightly sportier than a Gold Wing.
- Recommendation: Offer optional armrests or emphasize the new RT's improvements for passengers like legroom increase. Ensure wind protection also works for passengers without turbulent air hitting them.

Weight Management:
- Insight: Closely linked to low-speed maneuverability, concerns exist about the bike's overall heft, especially with options. The market trend towards lighter adventure bikes suggests a preference for manageability.
- Recommendation: Emphasize how the low center of gravity of the boxer helps. Consider features like reverse assist similar to K1600. The adaptive height system helps address weight concerns at stops.

Low-Speed Maneuverability:
- Insight: A specific concern for a subset of riders (older, shorter stature) and those managing weight, but not a universal primary purchase driver. Solutions like adaptive height are highly appreciated.
- Recommendation: Incorporate features to help with low-speed maneuvers. The new RT's adaptive height is brilliant and should be promoted as addressing low-speed stability for shorter riders.

Range & Fuel Efficiency:
- Insight: On long tours across Spain, range matters. The R1300RT's ~25-liter tank and efficient engine mean it can easily exceed 400 km on a fill. BMW managed to increase performance without increasing consumption.
- Recommendation: Keep optimizing engine efficiency. In marketing, point out practical benefits like riding Barcelona to Valencia on one tank. Highlight compatibility with E10 fuel and Euro5+ compliance.

Resale Value:
- Insight: Minimal direct discussion or explicit weighting as a purchase driver. Its influence is largely inferred through "Value for Money" and long-term ownership considerations.
- Recommendation: While not a primary marketing focus, ensure build quality and reliability support strong resale values. This indirectly supports the overall value proposition of BMW ownership.
